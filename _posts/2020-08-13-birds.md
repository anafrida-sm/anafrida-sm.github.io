Current studies show that some bird species from the Yucatán Peninsula are smaller than their counterparts on continental places in Mexico. We start from the idea that the reduction in the geographic extension of the Yucatán Peninsula (from 457,650 km2 to 225,182 km2 after Last Glacial Maximum) likely modified the extension of different habitats throughout the peninsula, which may have also promoted changes in the body size of different taxa. Here, we show tendencies in body size of some bird species from Late Pleistocene to the Holocene and test whether the reduction of the geographic size of the Yucatán Peninsula may have influenced the changes in the body size of some bird species. Based on measurements of the tarsometatarsus, a reliable proxy for overall body size, we performed statistical analyses to test differences among and between fossil birds from the archaeological-paleontological site of Loltún cave and non-fossil specimens from the same region. Our results show significant differences in the body size of fossil and non-fossil birds. In turn, these results suggest that relatively recent ecological factors may have promoted body size variations.


# Presentation  

I would like to start by telling you about the present day observation that gave us the idea for this project.

Castro-Navarro noted that _P. morio_ (Brown jay) is larger and darker in other regions of Mexico than in the Yucatan Peninsula, where they are smaller and lighter. He proposed that the Tehuantepec isthmus is a transition zone that split the population into two (Fig.1).

This made us wonder whether the changes in the extension of the Yucatán peninsula across time were related to the variation in body size of the regional bird species across time.

We can observe the changes in the extension (Fig.2). This map of the Pleistocene coastlines during the Last Glacial Maximum shows that the extension of the peninsula was greater back then than it is today. The reduction was due to a rise in sea level at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum around 12 000 years ago which covered the continental platform.

We chose two ecogeographic rules that could help us best describe the observed pattern to test whether the reduction of the platform affected the body size. Using these rules we could then propose the factors that could have influenced the change in body size.

1. The first rule is the island rule, which states that different taxa on islands show a reduction in size if they exceed a specific threshold in weight of around 100 grams in mammals. If they are below this threshold, the overall dimensions increase.

Another important part of this rule is the area-scale ratio, which indicates that in large areas there will be large sizes and vice versa.

2. The second rule is  Bergmann's rule. This rule describes the change in body size in endotherm organisms according to latitude and temperature. Speciphically, in cold higher latitudes there are larger body sizes while in warm lower latitudes there are smaller sizes.


Our hypotheses were (Fig. 4):
1. Small sizes in small areas and _vice versa_
2. North-south cline -> Bergmann's rule

Materials
 In figure 5 are the sites from where we took the sample:
* San Josecito Cave in the north
* Tlapacoya in central México
* And, Loltún Cave in Yucatán peninsula

Tlapacoya and Loltún materials are stored in th Laboratories and Academic Support Division (SLAA), INAH and the San Josecito Cave fossils are stored in the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.

Our sample consisted of three species of fossil birds (Table 1.)
And we compared the genus _Tyto_ from the Antilles too, and only for _T. alba_ we measured the femur.
We based on measurements of the tarsometatarsus, a reliable proxy for overall body size.

In the table 2 show the species of present-day birds (study skins).
To test Bergmann’s rule we took the mass in grams. And tarsusmetatarsi to compare fossils and non-fossils.

The method:

1. We assessed the measurement error by measuring study skins by only one person (AFS-M). We repeated measurements using a subsample of 10 specimens on three different days and, subsequently, we applied a Pearson correlation test. Almost all measurements for modern birds were taken from study skins.
2. We performed a Kruskal Wallis test to test differences between populations across time / and to _Tyto alba_ to test differences between sites in the Late Pleistocene.
3. We performed an ANOVA to test differences to north to south and Bonferroni post hoc (Bergmann's rule).

* Our results for _C.yncas_ and _O.vetula_ were similar in tendencies. Overall body size increased from Late Pleistocene to Present-day. The populations in the past were smaller than present-day populations.
* These changes were different than we expected because our first assumption was to find larger sizes in large areas, where it is possible to find greater resources. However, that in the past the area in Yucatán Peninsula was larger does not mean there were greater resources.

We have another example of resource limitation in the Yucatán Peninsula with _Tyto alba_ during the Late Pleistocene.

* On the one hand, when comparing specimens between the Yucatán Peninsula (YP) and Tlapacoya, and San Josecito, the YP specimens were smaller, which would agree with the island rule.
* On the other hand, when comparing specimens from Tlapacoya and San Josecito with specimens from the Antilles, the latter were giants.

Thus, the specimens from YP would have been smaller than the specimens from actual islands and therefore the island rule does not describe the pattern. The size of the prey could aid to explain the pattern: in the Antilles, Tyto preyed on monkeys and small sloths; in Loltún, they probably preyed on small rodents; whereas in San Josecito and Tlapacoya, they also preyed on rodents but possibly larger than those rodents from Loltún.

We observed a north-south cline in the pattern of body size using mass in current populations of _O. vetula_. This cline showed that _O. vetula_ from the YP have a smaller body size in comparison to northeastern Mexico and Texas populations.

Lastly, _M. momota_ shows two clines: 
1) A cline that corresponds to Bergmann’s rule: we observed a gradient from Veracruz to Tabasco (from large to small body mass). 
2) A cline that corresponds to the inverse Bergmann’s rule: here, we noted an increase in body mass from the state of Yucatán to Tabasco.

This clinal pattern is consistent with the principles of Bergmann’s rule, in which it is expected that as the temperature increases, the body size decreases. Climate conditions in the YP, specifically in the northern part, where our samples were taken, are hot and dry and the climate conditions in the regions where our continental samples were taken are more temperate in comparison to the YP.

In turn, these results suggest that relatively recent ecological factors may have promoted body size variations.

We propose two ecological factors in two paths (Fig. ):
1. Warmer regions -> Smaller body sizes
2. Geographic isolation -> Small size

__Conclusions__

The general warming of the Earth caused changes in the Yucatán Peninsula, which resulted in a warm and isolated area.
* The present day variations in body size in some birds from the Yucatán Peninsula follow the principles of the Bergmann’s rule.
* Changes in body size in Pleistocene species were inverse; the overall changes were from small to large sizes. 

Future work

The lack of superficial water is the main factor that affects species body size in the Yucatán Peninsula
