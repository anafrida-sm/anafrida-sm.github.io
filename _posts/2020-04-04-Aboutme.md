# About me

Hi! I am Ana Frida!
I am a biologist and monkey.

Currently I am working with Pleistocene fossil birds from Mexico. I am looking for patterns in variation 
in body size in some birds from the Yucatan peninsula. I hope someday find the explanations and with help of statistics maybe I could be able 
to tell something about the processes which generate that variation.

I worked in a project with archaeological birds from Teopancazco, Teotihuacan. In that project I was looking for the bird-human
relationship in a domestic context.
